SECTION A Data Joining using dplyr 
The anonymized dataset from Olist Store, capturing a wealth of ecommerce 
transactions across Brazil's marketplaces from 2016 to 2018. Encompassing data 
from 100,000 orders, this rich dataset presents multifaceted views of order details, 
including statuses, prices, payments, and shipping. Additionally, customer locales are 
tied to geographic coordinates via a comprehensive geolocation dataset. For privacy, 
any company-specific references in customer reviews have been creatively 
substituted with fictional names from a renowned fantasy series.

SECTION B: Visualization using ggplot2  
The article “customer sales analysis.pdf” investigates the power of diverse data 
visualization techniques in uncovering latent trends and patterns within customer sales 
data, a key driver of strategic decision-making in modern businesses. By utilizing a 
comprehensive array of 24 distinct visualization methods, ranging from various chart 
types like Doughnut, Area, and Bar, to more complex representations such as Mind 
Maps and Flow Charts, the study aims to extract critical insights about consumer 
behavior. The paper demonstrates how these insights, when effectively harnessed 
through adept analysis, can significantly enhance business agility and propel informed 
decision-making, underpinning successful business outcomes.
